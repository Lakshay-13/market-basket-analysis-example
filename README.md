Business Problem: Why is it Important?
Market basket analysis is crucial for businesses, especially in the retail sector, as it helps understand customer purchasing behavior by identifying patterns and associations between products. By analyzing these associations, businesses can optimize their inventory, design targeted marketing campaigns, and enhance cross-selling and up-selling strategies. For an online retail store, this analysis can lead to personalized recommendations, increasing customer satisfaction and boosting sales. Understanding product affinities allows the business to bundle products effectively, manage stock more efficiently, and ultimately drive profitability.
